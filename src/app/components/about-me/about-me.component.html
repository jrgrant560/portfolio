        <p>
            I’m a Full Stack Web Developer located in the United States, with experience in graphic design and
            operations management. My mojo is simplifying and streamlining company processes, making
            everyday tasks into a predictable checklist instead of a nebulous, untrackable art form.

            Autonomous worker, articulate speaker, always hunting overlooked details. Fan of
            animated movies, fantasy books, and stock investing. Single and trying to mingle.

            Endlessly fascinated by the lifelong pursuit of solving human pain with practical, win-win solutions.
            Teaching computers to help out is a no-brainer.
